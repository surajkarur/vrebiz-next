Place the provided logo image file here as `logo-business-beyond-borders.png`.

Steps:
1. Save the logo image (the one you attached) into this folder with the exact filename:
   `logo-business-beyond-borders.png`
2. Start the dev server (e.g., `pnpm dev` or `npm run dev`). The site will load the image at `/logo-business-beyond-borders.png`.

Notes:
- Components (`Navbar.tsx` and `Footer.tsx`) will try to load `/logo-business-beyond-borders.png`. If that file is not present, they will automatically fall back to the existing `src/assets/logo.png`.
- If you'd like, I can add the actual PNG into `public/` now — let me know and I'll add it for you.
